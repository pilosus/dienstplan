### Changed
- JDBC-access to a database migrated from
  [java.jdbc](https://github.com/clojure/java.jdbc) to
  [next.jdbc](https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc)
  ([#67](https://github.com/pilosus/dienstplan/issues/67)).
- Database connection pooling migrated from
  [HikariCP Clojure wrapper](https://github.com/tomekw/hikari-cp) to original

## [0.5.0] - 2023-06-16
### Changed

## [0.4.0] - 2023-06-03
### Added
- `update` command to update rotation's list of mentions and
  description. Watch out! The command overrides current on-call person
  even if the new list of mentions is the same as in original
  rotation. Consider the command to be a shortcut to a sequence of
  `delete` and `create` commands for the same rotation name.
  ([#66](https://github.com/pilosus/dienstplan/issues/66))
